# Mall-Customers-Regression-Model
## Build machine learning model using regression model.
- Y variable -> Spending Score(1-100)
- X variables -> Gender, Age, Annual Income($)
## Steps of building machine learning model.
- Install lazypredict library.
- Import pandas to load dataset.
- Load the dataset.
- Split data set into train and test set.
- Import lazypredict library .(inside lazypredict there are two classes called classification and Regression)
- Use lazyRegressor. (we are using regression)
- Display models and predictions and test models' performances.

## Used 'lazypredict' python library to check what kind of models performs well on the dataset.
- This library is just for testing purposes, giving you information on what kind of models performs well on your dataset.
